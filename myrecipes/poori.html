    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>Fine salt, to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water, approximately</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or ghee, plus more for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, take 2 cups of whole wheat flour.</li>
        <li>Now add the rave to the wheat flour.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp salt & 1/2 tsp sugar. Although adding sugar is totally optional.</li>
        <li>At this stage, add 3/4 cup water. Remember, the poor dough has to be tougher than chapati dough. A thicker dough is one of the reasons that will give a fluff in the poori.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough with minimal water but also keeping in mind that it comes together and is not dry.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a moist cloth and rest it for 30 minutes before using.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 cups of oil in a kadhai. Make sure that the oil is really hot.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough in thick discs, smaller & thicker than chapati/roti.</li>
         <li>The perfect way for the poor to fluff up is once the poori is slid into the oil from the corner, start pressing one side of the poori with a strainer ladle. Immediately the poori will fluff up.</li>
    </ol>
